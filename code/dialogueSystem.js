    /*  NOTE ON HOW DIALOGUE EVENTS WORK
        Each Dialogue Event is an Array containing several NODES. Each node is an object.

        REUQIRED PROPERTIES
        label: a string containing a label/name for the node
        speaker: a string with the name of the NPC stating the dialogue
        dialogue: a string containing the dialogue for that node

        OPTIONAL PROPERTIES
        goTo: A string that matches the label of the node to be displayed next
        func: write '() =>' then the name of the function + any parameters in brackets. '() =>' delays calling the function until node.func() is called in my script 
        (under updateDialogue!). If i just wrote e.g. 'func: endGame(kicked)' then it would be called when the the object is first created in setup(), not when 
        the dialogue is displayed!
        func2: same as func, but for nodes with more than one function attached
        response: an array containing further objects (see below)

        RESPONSE NODES:
        Some dialogue nodes contain an array with several RESPONSE NODES inside them. Response nodes REQUIRE the following PROPERTIES:
        r: a string describing the response
        goTo: which dialogue node the system should load next

        And my OPTIONALLY include the following PROPERTEIS:
        func: can load funcs from responses as described above

        EXAMPLE NODE:
        {label: "Name Node Here", speaker: "String for speaker", dialogue: "Write some dialogue to display on screen here", func: () => myFunction(), 
            response: [
                {r: "The player's first dialogue option", goTo: "label of node to load next"}
